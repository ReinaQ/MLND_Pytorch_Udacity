## Project Overview
### Finding charity donors
First chapter project was about applying **supervised learning techniques**, which helps CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.
It includes following steps:
* Evaluated the performance of different supervised learning algorithms (AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression)
* Optimized the selected model for best identifying potential donors

### Flower species image classifier

The goal of this project is to define and train **a neural network in PyTorch** that learns to classify images; going from image data exploration to network training and evaluation
It includes following steps:
- Implemented the Convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification with PyTorch
- Built the command line application for serving the model

### Identify Customer Segments with Arvato

The goal of the project in this chapter is to study a real dataset of customers for a company, and apply several **unsupervised learning techniques** in order to segment customers into similar groups and extract information that may be used for marketing or product improvement.
It includes following steps:
* Conducted data wrangling, and data dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis(PCA)
* Identified potential customers using clustering techniques
